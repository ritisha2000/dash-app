# DinoDash Dashboard Proposal

Author: Ritisha Sharma

## Section 1: Motivation and Purpose

**Target audience:** Middle and high school students interested in dinosaurs

There is an abundance of children who are interested in dinosaurs and there are many resources available to learn about the subject. However, they may not provide an idea of the broader trends relating to these prehistoric creatures. National History Museum's website offers a wealth of interesting information but focuses on individual dinosaurs. To address this issues, this dashboard is designed to bring together various features that can help students identify interesting patterns. Users will be able to explore the density of dinosaur species according to eating habits and geographic location which will hopefully provide insight about how these creatures adapted to different environments. It will also show the types of dinosaurs that lived in certain periods and locations. It is fascinating to look at individual dinosaurs so the dashboard includes a list of randomly selected dinosaurs based on their types, with links to National History Museums's webpage about that dinosaur to encourage users to delve deeper into their favorites.

## Section 2: Description of the Data

The "Jurassic Park - The Exhaustive Dinosaur Dataset" dataset is from Kaggle by a user, KamranJanjua, who has aggregated the information about dinosaurs using scraping from the [National History Museum's website](https://www.nhm.ac.uk/visit/galleries-and-museum-map/dinosaurs.html). There are 309 rows or names of dinosaurs contained in this dataset. Each row contains the details for identifying the dinosaur (`name`, `taxonomy`, `type`, `species`), the characteristics of the dinosaur (`diet`, `length`), and other information such as the when it lived during the era of the dinosaurs (`period`), area that it resided in which is mostly countries (`lived_in`), person who named it (`named_by`), and link to the National History Museum's website to learn more about this particular dinosaur (`link`). The data was scraped: it is licensed under the Creative Commons License.

I am also using "Countries ISO Codes" dataset to get the ISO codes for the countries in the main dataset to be able to make a map. It is licensed under CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0).

## Section 3: Research Questions

Mariam is in 9th grade. She had watched Jurassic Park a few years earlier which sparked her interest in Paleontology. She went to museums and read books about her favorite dinosaurs. As she gets closer to graduation, she wants to know more about dinosaurs than just list her favorite ones. The books and articles she finds are engaging but she wants to diversify her sources of learning. She wants to _explore_ the broader patterns regarding location and period and _identify_ key characteristics such as diet. She also wants to _compare_ individual dinosaurs of different types in certain periods and geographic locations. She opens the "DinoDash" app. First, she finds the overall distribution of the types of dinosaurs. Remembering back to the movie that started her journey, she switches the period to 'Early Jurassic". The location dropdown is updated so now she can only choose locations that had dinosaurs during that period so she chooses "Antarctica". She finds the type of dinosaur that lived then and there was "Large Theropod". She scrolls below and see that the dashboard has provided her with a dinosaur name, "Cryolophosaurus". She clicks on the name and is redirected to the National History Museum's website where she finds more details. After declaring this her new favorite dinosaur, she returns to the dashboard and switches to the next tab. She's very interested in the carnivorous dinosaurs and selects that in the options sidebar. The map updates and shows that there were 12 species that lived in China. She tries to understand why some regions had more species diversity. Her exploration of the dash app has led her to confidently declare paleontology as her future major.
